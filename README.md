# Pig_latin_translator
A basic translator to Pig Latin from Enligsh
Follows the basic "rules" of Pig Latin:(1) Simply adds "hay" to the end of words beginning with a vowel and (2) moves the first consonant (or consonant cluster) to the end of the word and adds "ay"
Handles "y" as a consonant since there is no way, as far as I know, to have the program differentiate between consonant "y" and vowel "y".
